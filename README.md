Code for the paper: "Semantic Conditioned Dynamic Modulation for Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos". This is an extension of my Neurips 2019 work, which has been accepted by TPAMI. The code is similar to the Neurips 2019 work, please refer the repository [https://github.com/yytzsy/SCDM/](https://github.com/yytzsy/SCDM/) for more details.
